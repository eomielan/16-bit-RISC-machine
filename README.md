# Simple RISC Machine

The Simple RISC Machine project represented the culmination of our CPEN 211 class, where my partner and I took on the task of designing a fundamental Central Processing Unit (CPU) architecture. The project included a complete hardware implementation using SystemVerilog, consisting of critical components including a FSM (Finite State Machine) controller, instruction decoder, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), register file, memory unit, and program counter.

During the development process, my partner and I meticulously ensured that the design followed all required specifications and standards. In the end, we succeeded in creating a functional and efficient CPU architecture that met all design requirements.

To validate the robustness and correctness of each individual component and the CPU as a complete system, my partner and I wrote an extensive set of testbenches in ModelSim. By executing these testbenches, we confirmed the correctness of every component in the CPU and verified its reliability.

The code is available uppon request. Please send an email to [eomielan@gmail.com](mailto:eomielan@gmail.com)
