# Simple RISC Machine

The Simple RISC Machine project represented the culmination of the CPEN 211 class, where my partner and I undertook the challenge of designing a fundamental Central Processing Unit (CPU) architecture. The project encompassed a comprehensive hardware implementation using SystemVerilog, consisting of critical components including an FSM (Finite State Machine) controller, instruction decoder, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), register file, memory unit, and program counter.

During the development process, my partner and I meticulously ensured that the design adhered to all required specifications and standards. Notably, we succeeded in creating a functional and efficient CPU architecture that met all design requirements.

To validate the robustness and correctness of each individual component and the CPU as a complete entity, my partner and I devised an exhaustive set of testbenches in ModelSim. By executing these testbenches, we confirmed the correctness of every component of the CPU and verified its reliability.

The code is available uppon request. Please send an email to [eomielan@gmail.com](mailto:eomielan@gmail.com)
